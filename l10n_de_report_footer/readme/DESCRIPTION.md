This module is the common base for the German report footer. It provides the
company footer configuration that report layouts share, so that the standard
Odoo layouts, the DIN 5008 layout shipped with Odoo (`l10n_din5008`, through
`l10n_din5008_footer`) and `layout_din5008` print the same footer content.

- **Company placeholders**: the footer text, the address and the tagline of
  the document layout can contain company data (phone, e-mail, VAT, bank
  account, ...) inserted with the dynamic placeholder picker of the HTML
  editor (type `/` in the editor). The placeholders are rendered when a
  report is printed. With the module `html_editor_icon` (OCA/web) installed,
  the same texts offer an `/icon` command to insert Font Awesome pictograms,
  for example in front of the phone number or the e-mail address.
- **Footer lines**: a shared QWeb hook (`l10n_de_report_footer.footer_lines`)
  in the company address block of every layout. Modules such as
  `l10n_de_report_footer_representative` add lines (representatives,
  register court, ...) once and they appear in every layout.
- **Bottom margin**: the bottom page margin of PDF reports can be increased
  in the document layout when the footer needs more space than the paper
  format reserves (previously the module `l10n_din5008_report_margin_bottom`).
- **Preview highlight**: while a field of the document layout that changes a
  size or a margin is focused, the affected area is outlined in the preview.
